## 1. What is Flutter?

### Introduction

Flutter is Google's **UI toolkit** for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.

### Key Features

- **Fast Development**: Hot reload helps you quickly experiment and build UIs
- **Beautiful UIs**: Rich set of customizable widgets
- **Native Performance**: Compiled to native ARM code
- **Single Codebase**: Write once, deploy to iOS, Android, Web, and Desktop

2. Extract the zip file to desired location (e.g., `C:\src\flutter`)
3. Add Flutter to PATH:
   - Search for "Environment Variables"
   - Edit PATH variable
   - Add `C:\src\flutter\bin`

#### Linux

```bash
# Download Flutter SDK
cd ~/development
git clone https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git -b stable

# Add Flutter to PATH
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/development/flutter/bin"

# Add to shell profile
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/development/flutter/bin"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

### Run Flutter Doctor

```bash
flutter doctor
```

This command checks your environment and displays a report:

```
Doctor summary (to see all details, run flutter doctor -v):

```
hello_flutter/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ android/          # Android native code
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ios/              # iOS native code
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/              # Dart code (main.dart)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test/             # Test files
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pubspec.yaml      # Project dependencies
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md         # Project documentation
```

### Understanding Key Files

**pubspec.yaml**
```yaml
name: hello_flutter
description: A new Flutter project.

dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  cupertino_icons: ^1.0.2

dev_dependencies:
  flutter_test:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_lints: ^2.0.0

flutter:
  uses-material-design: true
```

**lib/main.dart**
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(const MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(seedColor: Colors.deepPurple),
        useMaterial3: true,
      ),
      home: const MyHomePage(title: 'Flutter Demo Home Page'),
    );
  }
}
```

---

## 4. Running Your First App

### Start an Emulator/Simulator

```bash
# List available devices
flutter devices

# Start an emulator
flutter emulators --launch <emulator_id>
```

### Run the App

```bash
# Run in debug mode
flutter run

# Run on specific device
flutter run -d <device_id>

# Run in release mode
flutter run --release
```

### Hot Reload

While the app is running:
- Press `r` to hot reload
- Press `R` to hot restart
- Press `q` to quit

### VS Code Run Configuration

1. Open the project in VS Code
2. Press F5 or click "Run and Debug"
3. Select "Flutter" configuration
4. App will start running

---

## üíª Hands-on Exercise

### Exercise 1: Setup Verification

1. Run `flutter doctor` and resolve any issues
2. Create a new project: `flutter create my_first_app`
3. Run the project on an emulator
4. Verify hot reload works:
   - Change the app title
   - Press 'r' to hot reload
   - See the change immediately

### Exercise 2: Explore the Default App

1. Click the floating action button
2. Observe the counter increment
3. Read through the code in `main.dart`
4. Try changing:
   - App title
   - Primary color
   - Button icon
   - Counter increment value
