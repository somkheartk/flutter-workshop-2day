# Testing, Building & Deployment Demo

A comprehensive demonstration of Flutter testing with detailed code explanations. Shows unit tests, widget tests, and deployment preparation.

## ðŸ“‹ What You'll Learn

This example teaches you:
- âœ… **Unit Testing** - Testing business logic and functions
- âœ… **Widget Testing** - Testing UI components and interactions
- âœ… **Test Organization** - Grouping and structuring tests
- âœ… **Test Patterns** - AAA pattern, setUp, matchers
- âœ… **WidgetTester** - Simulating user interactions
- âœ… **Finders** - Locating widgets in tests
- âœ… **Best Practices** - Writing maintainable tests

## ðŸŽ¯ Features

### Tests Included
1. **Unit Tests (test/utils_test.dart)**
   - Calculator: Mathematical operations (5 tests)
   - Counter: State management with business rules (5 tests)
   - TodoList: Collection management and CRUD operations (6 tests)
   - TodoItem: Data model behavior (3 tests)

2. **Widget Tests (test/widget_test.dart)**
   - Counter UI: Initial state verification
   - Button Interactions: Tap simulation and state changes
   - Business Rules: Counter cannot go below 0
   - Complex Sequences: Multiple interactions
   - Widget Presence: Verifying UI elements exist

### Test Coverage
- âœ… 28 test cases (20 unit + 8 widget tests)
- âœ… Edge cases (zero, negative, empty)
- âœ… Error handling (division by zero)
- âœ… State management
- âœ… User interactions
- âœ… Business rules validation

## ðŸš€ How to Run

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK installed
- Project dependencies installed (`flutter pub get`)

### Running Tests

**1. Run ALL tests:**
```bash
cd day2/session4/example
flutter test
```

Expected output:
```
00:02 +28: All tests passed!
```

**2. Run specific test file:**
```bash
# Run only unit tests
flutter test test/utils_test.dart

# Run only widget tests
flutter test test/widget_test.dart
```

**3. Run tests with detailed output:**
```bash
# Verbose mode - shows each test as it runs
flutter test --verbose

# Show test names
flutter test --reporter expanded
```

**4. Run specific test group:**
```bash
# Run only Calculator tests
flutter test --name="Calculator"

# Run only Counter tests
flutter test --name="Counter"
```

**5. Run with coverage:**
```bash
flutter test --coverage

# This creates coverage/lcov.info file
```

### Running the App

```bash
flutter run
```

The app displays a simple counter with:
- Increment button (+)
- Decrement button (-)
- Reset button (â†»)
- Info card explaining testing concepts

## ðŸ“Š Test Results Explained

### Successful Test Output

```
00:00 +0: loading test/utils_test.dart
00:01 +0: Calculator Tests addition works correctly
00:01 +1: Calculator Tests subtraction works correctly
00:01 +2: Calculator Tests multiplication works correctly
...
00:02 +28: All tests passed!
```

**What This Means:**
- `+0, +1, +2...` : Number of tests passed so far
- `00:01, 00:02` : Time elapsed
- `All tests passed!` : Success! âœ…

### Failed Test Output

If a test fails:
```
00:01 +4 -1: Calculator Tests division works correctly [E]
  Expected: <3.0>
    Actual: <3.5>
```

**How to Fix:**
1. Read the error message
2. Find the failing test in the file
3. Check if expectation or code is wrong
4. Fix and run tests again
